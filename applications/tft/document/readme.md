# TFT library

* The TFT library provides a low-level interface for screen interaction, allowing developers to easily control the display content of the LCD.
* How to add TFT libraries in development and propose two strategies for adding and managing drivers for new devices: separating drivers and unifying drivers to achieve simpler and more efficient management.

## Basic steps for adding TFT libraries

* Choose a suitable TFT library: First, you need to choose a TFT library that matches the LCD screen model and specifications you are using. These libraries are typically provided by LCD screen suppliers or can be obtained from open source communities.

* Initialize TFT library: During the initialization phase of the project, call the TFT library's initialization function and set necessary parameters, such as screen resolution, color depth, etc.

* Write calling code: Call the functions provided by the TFT library to draw points and rectangles where LCD display needs to be controlled.

## Separation drive strategy

* The strategy of separating drivers is a good choice for adding drivers to new devices. The core idea of this strategy is to separate the driver code of each device into a separate module or file.

* Create Driver Module: Create an independent driver module for each new device, including initialization, configuration, and control functions for that device.

* Registration and invocation: Implement a driver registration mechanism in the TFT library or main program. When a new device is connected, its driver module is added to the system through a registration function. The main program controls different devices by calling the registered driver interface.

* Scalability: This strategy makes it easy to add new devices by simply writing the driver module for the new device and registering it, without the need to modify existing code.

## Unified driving strategy

* The unified driver strategy is to integrate the driver code of multiple devices into a unified driver module. This strategy is suitable for situations where the differences between devices are small or require unified management and control.

* Abstract interface: Define a unified driver interface that includes functions and methods common to all devices.

* Implementation details: Implement specific details of the interface for each device in a unified driver module. Distinguish the operations of different devices through conditional compilation or runtime judgment.

* Simplified calling: The main program only needs to call a unified driver interface, without worrying about specific device differences.

## Management recommendations

* Regardless of the strategy adopted, effective management of TFT libraries and driver code is necessary. Suggestions are as follows:

* Documentization: Write detailed documentation for each device and driver module, explaining their usage, parameters, and precautions.

* Version control: Use a version control system (such as Git) to manage TFT libraries and driver code, recording the history and reasons for each change.

* Testing and Verification: After adding new devices or modifying driver code, conduct sufficient testing and verification to ensure the stability and reliability of the system.

Through the above steps and strategies, we can effectively add and manage TFT libraries, making LCD development more efficient and convenient. At the same time, it also lays a solid foundation for subsequent equipment expansion and maintenance.

The specific implementation method can be seen through the file, how to create a new driver, and record it.
