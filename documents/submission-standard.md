# git commit

## why is submission standard

When we use git commit to make changes to a project, it can be challenging when someone submits code that does not adhere to our established standards.  
Sometimes, the information provided in the commit message is insufficient, making it difficult to understand the contents and intent of the changes.  
To address this issue and ensure everyone is on the same page, it is crucial to have a submission standard overall that we all adhere to. This will enhance the clarity and efficiency of our collaborative work.
